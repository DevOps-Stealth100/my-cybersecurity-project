    <!-- SECTION 1: What is Sextortion & Online Extortion? -->
    <section class="what-is-sextortion">
      <h3>‚ö† What is Sextortion & Online Extortion?</h3>
      <p>
        Sextortion and online extortion involve criminals threatening to release private or embarrassing information ‚Äî often intimate images or videos ‚Äî unless victims pay money or provide more compromising content. These threats are delivered through emails, social media, messaging apps, or even phone calls.
      </p>
      <p>
        Victims feel fear, shame, and pressure to comply, even if the threats are fake. Cybercriminals exploit emotions to extract money, gift cards, crypto payments, or further personal details.
