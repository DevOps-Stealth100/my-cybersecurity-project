    <section class="what-is-bec">
      <h3>üìß What is Business Email Compromise (BEC)?</h3>
      <p>
        Business Email Compromise (BEC) is a sophisticated cybercrime where attackers trick businesses into sending money or sensitive data by hijacking or spoofing trusted email accounts ‚Äî usually of executives or finance staff.
      </p>
      <p>
        These attacks often look incredibly real, using techniques like fake invoices, urgent wire transfer requests, or fake messages from CEOs or vendors.

    <!-- SECTION 2: How BEC Works -->
    <section class="how-it-works">
      <h3>üïµ‚Äç‚ôÇ How BEC Attacks Work</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The attacker gains access to or mimics a legitimate business email account.</li>
        <li>They carefully study communication patterns and targets (e.g., the finance team).</li>
        <li>A convincing email is sent requesting urgent payment or confidential data.</li>
        <li>The employee unknowingly responds or transfers funds to a fake bank account.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Because BEC attacks often involve no malware, they‚Äôre hard to detect with traditional security tools.
