      <h3 class="crime-section-title">🎣 What is Phishing?</h3>
      <p>
        Phishing attacks are one of the most common — and dangerous — cybercrimes in the world.
        In a phishing attack, cybercriminals pose as trusted companies, banks, or government agencies
        to trick you into revealing personal information like passwords, credit card numbers, or banking details.
      </p>
      <p>
        They often use emails, text messages, phone calls, or fake websites that look almost identical to the real thing.
        The goal? Steal your money, your identity, or both.

      <p>
        Phishing isn’t just small-time scams — some of the biggest cyber heists in history started with a simple email:
      </p>
      <ul class="crime-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Google & Facebook Scam (2013–2015):</strong>
          Over $100 million stolen when a scammer impersonated a hardware supplier and sent fake invoices.
          <em>(Source: U.S. Department of Justice)</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>RSA Security Breach (2011):</strong>
          Hackers used phishing emails with malicious Excel files, leading to stolen data about secure tokens used by defense contractors.
          <em>(Source: RSA)</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>World Health Organization Scam (2020):</strong>
          During COVID-19, scammers sent emails pretending to be WHO, tricking people into clicking malicious links.
          <em>(Source: Europol and Interpol)</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These cases show how even giant corporations and governments can fall victim if individuals click the wrong link.
