    <section class="what-is-fake-job-scam">
      <h3>🎯 What are Fake Job Recruitment Scams?</h3>
      <p>
        Fake job scams involve criminals posing as employers or recruiters to trick job seekers into sharing personal details, sending money, or working without pay. Scammers may use fake company websites, job boards, emails, or social media to appear legitimate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Victims often believe they’ve secured a real job—until they’re asked to pay fees, share banking info, or realize the job doesn’t exist.

    <!-- SECTION 2: How They Work -->
    <section class="how-it-works">
      <h3>🕵 How Fake Job Scams Work</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Scammers post fake job listings on job boards or social media.</li>
        <li>Victims apply and quickly receive “job offers.”</li>
        <li>Scammers request personal details, banking info, or upfront fees for training, equipment, or background checks.</li>
        <li>Some scams involve fake checks where victims “refund” money before discovering the check is fake.</li>
        <li>Fraudsters may impersonate real companies to look legitimate.</li>
      </ul>
