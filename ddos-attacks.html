    <!-- SECTION 1: What are DDoS Attacks? -->
    <section class="what-is-ddos">
      <h3>üåê What are DDoS Attacks?</h3>
      <p>
        A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack floods a website, server, or network with overwhelming amounts of traffic from multiple sources, making it slow, unresponsive, or completely unavailable. Unlike hacking, DDoS attacks aim to disrupt rather than steal data.
      </p>
      <p>
        These attacks can last minutes, hours, or even days, causing businesses to lose revenue, trust, and critical services.
      </p>

    <!-- SECTION 2: How DDoS Attacks Work -->
    <section class="how-it-works">
      <h3>üöÄ How DDoS Attacks Work</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Cybercriminals use malware to control thousands of devices (called a ‚Äúbotnet‚Äù).</li>
        <li>They instruct the botnet to flood a target with massive traffic requests.</li>
        <li>The server becomes overwhelmed and crashes or slows to a crawl.</li>
        <li>Attackers sometimes demand ransom to stop the attack.</li>
        <li>DDoS is also used as a distraction while criminals carry out other attacks.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        DDoS attacks are often measured in gigabits or terabits per second of traffic.

      <h3>üö® Notable DDoS Attack Cases</h3>

    <!-- SECTION 4: How to Protect Yourself -->
    <section class="protect-yourself">
      <h3>üõ° How to Stay Safe from DDoS Attacks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Businesses should use DDoS protection services from cloud providers or security vendors.</li>
        <li>Monitor network traffic for unusual spikes in activity.</li>
        <li>Have incident response plans to handle attacks quickly.</li>
        <li>Individuals are rarely direct targets, but their devices can become part of botnets if infected with malware.</li>
        <li>Keep software updated and secure IoT devices to avoid contributing to botnets.</li>
      </ul>
