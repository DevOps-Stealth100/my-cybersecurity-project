      <h3>💳 What is ATM & Card Cloning?</h3>
      <p>
        ATM and card cloning crimes involve criminals copying data from your debit or credit card’s magnetic stripe or chip. They use this stolen data to create fake cards, withdraw cash, or make purchases—often before the victim even knows their information was compromised.
      </p>
      <p>
        Card cloning is often carried out with hidden skimming devices installed on ATMs, gas pumps, or payment terminals.

    <!-- SECTION 2: How It Works -->
    <section class="how-it-works">
      <h3>🔍 How ATM & Card Cloning Works</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Criminals secretly attach skimming devices over ATM slots or point-of-sale machines.</li>
        <li>These devices read and copy magnetic stripe data from cards as they’re inserted.</li>
        <li>Hidden cameras capture PIN codes typed by unsuspecting users.</li>
        <li>Criminals use the stolen data to produce counterfeit cards and drain bank accounts.</li>
        <li>Modern skimmers can be tiny and nearly impossible to detect by eye.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Some criminals even use Bluetooth or wireless tech to collect stolen card data from skimmers remotely.
