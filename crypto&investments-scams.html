    <section class="what-are-crypto-scams">
      <h3>💰 What are Crypto & Investment Scams?</h3>
      <p>
        Crypto scams and investment fraud trick people into handing over money with promises of quick profits, high returns, or secret investment opportunities. Scammers exploit social media, fake websites, celebrity endorsements, and flashy apps to appear legitimate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once victims invest, scammers disappear—or worse, keep convincing them to send more money with false promises of bigger profits.

    <!-- SECTION 2: How These Scams Work -->
    <section class="how-it-works">
      <h3>🕵‍♂ How Crypto & Investment Scams Operate</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Scammers launch fake crypto exchanges or trading platforms.</li>
        <li>They pay small “profits” at first to gain trust (a Ponzi tactic).</li>
        <li>Victims are persuaded to invest larger sums for “bigger gains.”</li>
        <li>Eventually, withdrawals are blocked and scammers vanish.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Some scams involve social engineering, where fake “friends” online lure victims into fake crypto opportunities.
